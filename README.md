# 🌍 Translation Management System – Full Stack React Test
@ Created By Bar  

Welcome to my technical test project!  
This repository contains a **full-stack translation management system** built with **React (frontend)** and **C# (backend)**.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate **frontend architecture, backend API design, UX thinking, and scalable system design**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

In many production systems, translations are stored as **JSON files**.  
While this format is convenient for developers, it is **not user-friendly for business teams** and often **slows down deployment**.

This project solves this problem by introducing a **centralized translation management application** that allows:

- Business teams to manage translations easily.
- Developers to deploy translations instantly.
- Centralized control of translations across multiple applications.
